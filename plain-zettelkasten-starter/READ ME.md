# Plain Zettelkasten Starter

## Abstract

This starter kit creates a set of templates, folder structure and explainer notes for setting up a markdown based Zettlelkasten note taking system.

## Details

I have made several attempts to start a Zettelkasten based note organisation and workflow but it always seems to end up as a commonplace notebook with hierarchical note linking instead of a Zettelkasten. I have decided to setup and maintain a starter kit to help improve adherence to a Zettlekasten methodology.

Primarily, these templates have been developed with a mostly default [Obsidian][https://obsidian.md] install being used as the editor.

I have taken a lot of ideas from the [zettelkasten-starter-kit](https://github.com/groepl/Obsidian-Zettelkasten-Starter-Kit) which is an excellent starter kit but goes against my own person design philosophy that notes should be standalone and platform agnostic as possible.
